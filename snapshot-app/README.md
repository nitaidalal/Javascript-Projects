# 📸 Snapshot App

The **Snapshot App** is a modern, responsive, and privacy-friendly photo capture tool built with pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It uses the **MediaDevices API** to access the user's camera, allowing them to take quick snapshots directly from their browser — no external dependencies or frameworks needed.

> ⚠️ Note: Works best on desktop browsers with camera access enabled.
